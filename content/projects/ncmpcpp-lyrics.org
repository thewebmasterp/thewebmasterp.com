** What problem does ncmpcpp-lyrics solve?
I love my [[https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp][ncmpcpp]] CLI music player and have spent countless hours building my library of stolen music while pretending I am programming. When the time to add lyrics to my few thousand music files came, I finally decided to harness my programming skills and code this tool that fetches the lyrics for each song and stores them in the appropriate format.
** How does it solve it?
To fetch the lyrics, ncmpcpp-lyrics uses the [[https://docs.genius.com/][Genius API]]. If it doesn't find lyrics for a song, it simply lists the song in red at the end. If it finds the lyrics it puts them in a text file and outputs them to the specified output directory.
** Features
I'll simply print the help menu for you, right there:

  NAME:
    ncmpcpp-lyrics - Add lyrics to your music library. Compatible with ncmpcpp
    music player.

  SYNOPSIS:
    ncmpcpp-lyrics [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] [LYRICS DIR] -a [ACCESS TOKEN FILE PATH]
    ncmpcpp-lyrics [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] -a [ACCESS TOKEN FILE PATH] [LYRICS DIR]
    ncmpcpp-lyrics -a [ACCESS TOKEN FILE PATH] [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] [LYRICS DIR]

  DESCRIPTION:
     Iterate [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] recursively and extract all paths to mp3 files.
    From each mp3 file (from its file name) extract
    author and title properties and using the Genius API fetch lyrics (only if
    they do not already exist in [LYRICS DIR]). Save the lyrics to [LYRICS DIR]
    in format '{author} - {title}.txt', the format used by the ncmpcpp music
    player to read and write lyrics.

     In order for this little CLI program to be able to fetch lyrics from the
    Genius API, you need to provide it with a text file containing ACCESS_TOKEN
    that you can obtain from https://genius.com/api-clients and set via the
    --access-token-file flag

     [MUSIC LIBRARY DIR] must contain mp3 files with file names describing
    data like the title and author of the piece in format:
    '{author} - {whatever you want} - {however you want} - {title}.mp3'
     The only two requirements are that the file name starts with the
    author of the song, separated from other metadata you might (or might not)
    want to include with a dash (' - ') and ends with the title
    of the musical piece.

  FLAGS:

    -a, --access-token-file
      Path to a file containing in plain text access token for the Genius API

    -h, --help
      Print this help menu.
