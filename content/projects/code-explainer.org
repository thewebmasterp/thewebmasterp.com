** What is the Code Explainer?
The Code Explainer is a platform for presenting code to people, built with React. Words lose meaning when you can [[https://code-explainer.thewebmasterp.com][test out]] the application and see for yourself. Right now, it consists only of a front-end implementation, lacking any serious backend, but I aim at changing that in the future to allow users to present/view/discuss code explanations.

To learn more and look at the source code, visit its [[https://github.com/thewebmasterp/code-explainer][Github repo]].
** Features
*** Code clicking
[[../../img/projects/clickcode.gif]]

You click on a code line, and the appropriate slide gets activated to explain what this line does.
*** Unknown term info
[[../../img/projects/popup.gif]]

You read through the slide, and it mentions /terms/, /variables/ and /topics/. Don't you know any of it? Click on it. A popup will appear, giving you more details. Don't you understand some term/variable/topic from the popup? Click on it. You can do this forever until you understand the topic, close all the popups and continue sliding!
*** Sliding
[[../../img/projects/nextprev.gif]]

Did you finish reading the current slide? Tap on the arrows to view the next/previous one.
