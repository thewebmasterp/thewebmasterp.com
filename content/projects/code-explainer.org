** What is the Code Explainer?
The Code Explainer is a platform for presenting code to people, built with React. Words lose meaning when you can just [[https://code-explainer.thewebmasterp.com][test out]] the application and see for yourself. Right now it consists only of a front-end implementation, lacking any serious backend but I aim at changing that in the future to allow users to present/view/discuss code explanations.

To learn more and look at the source code, visit its [[https://github.com/thewebmasterp/code-explainer][Github repo]].
** Features
*** Code clicking
[[../../img/projects/clickcode.gif]]

You click on a code line and the appropriate slide gets activated to explain to you what this line does.
*** Unknown term info
[[../../img/projects/popup.gif]]

You read through the slide and it mentions /terms/, /variables/, /topics/. You don't know any of them? Click on it. A popup will appear giving you more details. You don't understand some term/variable/topic from the popup? Click on it. You can do this forever until you understand the topic, close all the popups and continue sliding!
*** Sliding

You finished reading the current slide? Tap on the arrows to view the next/previous one.
