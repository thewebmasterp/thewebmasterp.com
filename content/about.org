Hi, I am Zdravko Dimov, aka thewebmasterp.
(üìç Dobrich, Bulgaria)

I am a self-taught front-end web developer specializing in JavaScript and its ecosystem, aiming at full-stack and a broader understanding of software engineering.

I love [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][Free and open-source software]] and some of its deserving-a-mention representatives like [[https://archlinux.org/about/][Arch Linux]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] are deeply ingrained into my development workflow, just like the moral principles they convey.

In my spare time, I do Aikido.

I've been actively working on [[https://www.instagram.com/webmaster_project/][webmaster_project]] (2019 - 2021) - Without false modesty, it is the most in-depth coverage of various JavaScript concepts available on Instagram.

At the end of May 2022, after a while of keeping my mouth shut and just coding, I felt that my view on things has changed and webmaster_project, with its JavaScript-centric content and audience, is no longer the right stage for my voice, burning to speak out in a broader than "Just JavaScript" fashion. This was why this blog was born, as well as out of the necessity of selling my skills to potential allies.
** Work Experience, My Journey, Getting Personal
Well, this year (2022) I've just graduated from high school. I started doing graphic design 5 years ago since this was the specialty of my class.

This got me interested in HTML and CSS, soon after that, I had to learn JavaScript which eventually turned into my beloved programming language. Now I know that there's no such a thing as a favorite language, it's all the same, the same patterns repeating over and over in most programming languages and it's all about the problem solving;

Back on topic, soon after that I started [[https://www.instagram.com/webmaster_project/][webmaster_project]] where I covered many JavaScript & React concepts, Algorithms & DS, people liked it so I got a few little gigs (all by their request), like modifying a Shopify theme, teaching JavaScript and Algorithms & DS to beginners (the guy got a job lol) and even writing JavaScript homeworks for university students haha. I regret doing this evil... Anyway, it got me some #goodForAKid bucks.

Then I lost it all... üòµüí∏. I got hacked. Spyware or something. [[https://www.google.com/search?q=dd+disk+destroyer&client=firefox-b-d&sxsrf=ALiCzsY0HsDygDjQRwOxu3HwvTA_rmHg5A%3A1657544747729&ei=KyDMYs3xK9ioxc8P69Wx8A0&ved=0ahUKEwiNs4yv8_D4AhVYVPEDHetqDN4Q4dUDCA0&uact=5&oq=dd+disk+destroyer&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECc6BwgAEEcQsAM6BwgAELADEEM6CggAEOQCELADGAE6DwguENQCEMgDELADEEMYAjoICC4QgAQQ1AI6BAgAEEM6BQgAEIAEOgcIIxDqAhAnOgcILhDUAhBDOgsILhCABBDHARDRAzoKCAAQgAQQhwIQFDoFCAAQkQI6BggAEB4QFjoICAAQHhAWEAo6BQghEKABOggIABCABBDJAzoKCC4QxwEQ0QMQQzoECC4QQzoICAAQHhAPEBZKBAhBGABKBAhGGAFQ1AdYlTZgpjdoCnABeAGAAcECiAHnKJIBCDAuMTkuNy4xmAEAoAEBsAEKyAERwAEB2gEGCAEQARgJ2gEGCAIQARgI&sclient=gws-wiz][dd]] Windows. Install Arch Linux (Read more about my [[./blog/Desktop Setup/The Arch Linux journey.org][Arch Linux Journey]]). Which led me to a whole year away from JavaScript and full involvement in the exploration of Linux. Then, after doing math for a few months because I understood it will help me with programming, I was back with the Code Explainer (live link soon) built with React, hosted on my [[./img/host.jpg][Raspberry Pi]] (same I use for this website) which I got part-by-part from China (No budget ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø who knows why... ü•≤).

The last year or so, the main topic of my work has been "Scripting i3 window manager with JavaScript", I built [[https://www.npmjs.com/~thewebmasterp][some npm packages]] like the config-modules (link soon) and I also got into Emacs.

A few months before graduating, I set this goal that I want to get a job with JavaScript and since then I've been revising my definitive guide, solving katas on [[https://www.codewars.com/users/thewebmasterp][Code Wars]], building this website and fixing bugs in my portfolio projects.

I used to be very active over at [[https://www.instagram.com/webmaster_project/][Instagram]] which contains many highlights of my programming journey.

*** Getting personal 
 A word about my personality is that I hate being rejected & being cheeky which turns into a whole philosophy of "Be the best so that you'll be the one needed, not the one in need".
 
  For good or bad, I am a perfectionist - Just look at this website - It is simple but perfect. Hell, look at it, it has a [[./SomeStupidPage.org][404 page]] and a bunch of other error pages, if you send the joke that you see on the [[./contact.org][contact me]] page in the message section, the mail will auto reply with the answer, It has a nice spinning loader, dark and light color themes, a beautiful parallax effect (on the [[./index.org][home]] page) made with CSS only, custom Webpack config and as I am speaking about this website...

Or more about the technology behind this website.
*** Build
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d8dfcc1e-77b2-4d28-bcc1-f7f1191fa712
:END:
This website uses [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/org/ox-publish.el][ox-publish]] to convert [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] files into static HTML files as well as [[https://webpack.js.org/][Webpack]] to bundle, compile and minify [[https://sass-lang.com/][Sass]] and js files (into a single, optimized CSS or js file).
*** Deployment
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bc2ac0e5-d787-4f69-93bd-e00aae6f1baf
:END:
For deploying the build to [[./img/host.jpg][my Raspberry Pi B]]  and Github (so that you guys can see [[https://github.com/thewebmasterp/thewebmasterp.com][the source code]]) a few things happen:
1. Locally
   1. I do a ~git push~.
   2. This pushes my commits to the remote repository located on the Raspberry Pi.
   3. A local [[https://git-scm.com/][git]] hook is triggered that copies files from the main repository to a separate one which is then pushed to a source code hosting service (Github).
2. On the Raspberry Pi
   1. A push is received.
   2. This triggers a hook that does a few things:
      1. It creates a new [[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] image out of the already mentioned build.
      2. It replaces the old container (running the old image) with a brand new container (running the newly generated one).
*** Backend
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bdce058e-fda8-4e27-937b-533595cf82c5
:END:
 For the backend, I try not to reinvent the wheel and just stick to self-hosting the best bug-proven, free and open-source software available, each instance residing into its own Docker container, isolated from the rest, ready to serve its API for our needs.
Currently I self-host the following services:
+ [[https://remark42.com/][Remark42]]: Commenting Engine; located at ~remark42.thewebmasterp.com~
+ [[https://matomo.org/][Matomo]]: Web Analytics; located at ~matomo.thewebmasterp.com~
