Hi, I am Zdravko Dimov or just thewebmasterp. I am a Software engineer working in the field of JavaScript and its ecosystem - Mongo, Express, React, Node, etc. Based in Bulgaria.
 
I am also an advocate of [[https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html][Free and open-source software]], both contributing to it and using it, some of my favorite examples of such being [[https://archlinux.org/about/][Arch Linux]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]].

In my spare time, I like doing Aikido.

** My Writings
I've been actively working on [[https://www.instagram.com/webmaster_project/][webmaster_project]] - Without false modesty, it is the most in-depth coverage of various JavaScript concepts available on Instagram, from early 2019 to middle 2021.

At the end of May 2022, after a while of keeping my mouth shut and just coding, I felt that my view on things has changed and webmaster_project, with its JavaScript-centric content and audience, is no longer the right stage for my voice, burning to speak out in a broader than "Just JavaScript" fashion. This was how this blog was born.
